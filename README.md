My Contributions:
Created the weapon system: 
- Placed towers (with the exception of the Energy Tower) can only fire at a single target in range.
- Towers adopt a specific strategy based on the enemy's threat level, health and distance to their objective.
- Each tower type is given unique fire rate, damage and range characteristics. 
- The "Lightning Tower" targets the strongest enemy in its range
